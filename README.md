## Projects
### Furniture Insights: A Data-Driven Approach to Sales and Financial Analysis

In this project, I leveraged financial and sales data from a furniture chain company to provide actionable insights through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Using Python's pandas library, I cleaned and transformed the data from Excel sheets, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. Subsequently, I created a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard that visualized key metrics, trends, and performance indicators related to sales and financials. This dashboard served as a powerful tool for stakeholders, providing them with a clear and intuitive understanding of the company's current sales and financial situation. Additionally, I prepared and delivered a presentation that effectively communicated the insights gleaned from the data, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and present them in a compelling and actionable manner, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and business success.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
